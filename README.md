# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practice in Java and Kotlin

This repository contains a collection of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practice programs implemented in Java and Kotlin. The programs cover various OOP concepts and serve as a way to enhance my understanding of these languages and their application in software development.

## Java Programs

- `Example.java`: A basic Java class demonstrating the structure of a class, constructor, and method definitions.
- `InheritanceDemo.java`: Illustrates inheritance with parent and child classes, showcasing method overriding.
- `PolymorphismDemo.java`: Demonstrates polymorphism through method overloading and interfaces.
- `EncapsulationDemo.java`: Highlights encapsulation by using private fields and public methods.
- `AbstractionDemo.java`: Introduces abstraction using abstract classes and methods.

## Kotlin Programs

- `KotlinBasics.kt`: Covers basic Kotlin syntax, nullable types, and safe null handling.
- `DataClasses.kt`: Introduces Kotlin's data classes for concise POJO creation.
- `Inheritance.kt`: Translates the Java inheritance example into Kotlin.
- `Interfaces.kt`: A Kotlin version of the polymorphism example, showcasing interfaces and method overriding.
- `NullableTypes.kt`: Explores Kotlin's nullable types and safe call operator.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the programs in both Java and Kotlin. You can run the code samples individually in your preferred Java and Kotlin development environments.

1. Clone the repository:
